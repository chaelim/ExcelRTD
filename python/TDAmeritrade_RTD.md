# TD Ameritrade RTD

## Caveat

> This project is work in progress and haven't been tested extensively. You may exprience various issues. Also the Python code quality is not where I want to be yet.

## Introduction

* TD Ameritrade offers Level I and II live stream quotes free of charge if you have an account with them. (You can open an account without any deposit). See https://www.tdameritrade.com/api.page for more details.
* This Excel TD RTD utilizes the Level I live stream quotes to update TD RTD stockquote function in Excel in realtime.

## How to install

* First, please follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/chaelim/ExcelRTD/blob/master/python/README.md)
* Run `py td_rtd.py --register` to register TD RTD.

## Features

* OAuth login to your TD Ameritrade account via web browser and the refresh token will be saved for next login.
* Refresh token is encrypted and stored under `%APPDATA%` folder. As long as your refresh token is valid, no OAuth login is necessary.
* Currently supports all Level I live stream quotes via [TD Ameritrade Streaming Data](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/streaming-data).
    * [TD Level I Quote Document](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/streaming-data#_Toc504640597).
    * For full field list look for `level_one_quote` in [fields.py](https://github.com/chaelim/ExcelRTD/blob/master/python/tdapi/fields.py).
* Unlike the `tos.rtd` provided by ThinkorSwim platform, you don't need to install and run the TOS softfware to use the RTD in Excel.

## Security Concerns

* As mentioned above, the OAuth token is encrypted with your Windows account credential and stored under `%APPDATA%` folder. Unless somebody can log in or unlock the machine using your Windows account credential, it can't be easily decrypted.
* TD RTD only sends quote requests to the TD Ameritrade server.
* Never send any other information to any unknown servers.

## Demo
